This github repository shares the data and codes used for conducting a Monte Carlo simulation study regarding how much farmers can pay for weeding robots.

Hardware required: CPU

Software required: python, Excel

Program language: python

Data format: excel file, pandas dataframe stored in pikle files

Data size: 402 KB for raw data extracted from KTBL (https://www.ktbl.de/) and 197 MB for generated data from the simulation

First year available: 2022

Contact information: Linmei Shang, Institute for Food and Resource Economics (ILR), University of Bonn, Nu√üallee 21, 53115 Bonn, Germany (E-mail address: linmei.shang@ilr.uni-bonn.de)

This repository contains 4 folders. Their functions are decribed below.


# 1. Data 
This folder contains the raw data extracted from KTBL, including: 

 1) Conventional sugar beet farm planning data: working steps and gross margin;
 
 2) Organic sugar beet farm planning data: working steps and gross margin.

# 2. Calculation in Excel
This folder contains four examples (two from each farming system) illustrasting how the break-even price, i.e. Maximum Acquisition Value (MAV), is calculated.

This can also be used as a validation tool to check if the MAVs are correct.

# 3. Code
This folder contains the following codes: 

  1) python code to conduct Monte Carlo simulation for both farming systems (sugarbeet_org.py, sugarbeet_conv.py)
  
  2) python code to collect the results generated by the previous code (collect_data.py)
  
  3) python code to generate MAV plot(MAV_histogram.py)
  
  4) python code to generate size-mech plots (size-mech-plots.py)
  
  5) python code to generate the result tables (result_tables_conv.py, result_tables_org.py)


# 4. Results
This folder contains the data generated from the Monte Carlo simulation, including:

  1) 3 pkl files for conventional farming and 8 files for organic farming
  
  2) 6 excels files summarizing the results from the generated data
  
  3) three plots depicting the generated data
