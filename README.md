# 2. Calculation in Excel
This folder contains four examples (two from each farming system) illustrasting how the break-even price, i.e. Maximum Acquisition Value (MAV), is calculated.

# 3. Code
This folder contains the following codes: 
  a. python code to conduct Monte Carlo simulation for both farming systems (sugarbeet_org.py, sugarbeet_conv.py)
  b. python code to collect the results generated by the previous code (collect_data.py)
  c. python code to generate MAV plot(MAV_histogram.py)
  d. python code to generate size-mech plots (size-mech-plots.py)
  e. python code to generate the result tables (result_tables_conv.py, result_tables_org.py)


# 4. Results
